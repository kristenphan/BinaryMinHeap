__Assignment Description:__

The first step of the HeapSort algorithm is to create a heap from the array you want to sort. By the
way, did you know that algorithms based on Heaps are widely used for external sort, when you need
to sort huge files that don’t fit into memory of a computer?
Your task is to implement this first step and convert a given array of integers into a heap. You will
do that by applying a certain number of swaps to the array. Swap is an operation which exchanges
elements 𝑎𝑖 and 𝑎𝑗 of the array 𝑎 for some 𝑖 and 𝑗. You will need to convert the array into a heap using
only 𝑂(𝑛) swaps, as was described in the lectures. Note that you will need to use a min-heap instead
of a max-heap in this problem.

If you're currently taking the same course, please refrain yourself from checking out this solution as it will be against Coursera's Honor Code and won’t do you any good. Plus, once you're worked your heart out and was able to solve a particularly difficult problem, a sense of confidence you gained from such experience is priceless :)
